The conserved clinical variation visualization tool (ConVarT) is an online visualization resource developed by the Kaplan Lab, with the goal of displaying the evolutionary conservation of amino acid substitutions associated with diseases and non-clinically significant amino acid substitutions from ClinVar, COSMIC and gnomAD databases, and allowing easy access to collections of conserved genes and conserved variants associated with human diseases for the model organism research community. In addition, PTMs (post-translational modifications) are also integrated into the corresponding positions of amino acids on the human protein sequences. 

All genes consisting of all types of amino acid substitutions from ClinVar (329,338 amino acid variations), COSMIC (6,842,627 amino acid variations) and gnomAD (16,179,380 amino acid variations) databases have been extracted, and a series of multiple sequence alignments of ortholog genes between Human, Chimp, Macaca, Zebrafish, Mouse, Rat, Xenopus, Drosophila, and C. elegans were conducted, with integration of all amino acid substitutions and Pfam protein domains into the corresponding positions. The data visualization tool is freely available for the benefit of the scientific community.
